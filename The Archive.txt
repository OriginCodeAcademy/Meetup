Hello, and welcome to the archive!  This is intended to help keep track of handy links and recommendations provided on Origin's Slack to ensure that useful links such as internet articles, tutorials, and more don't get lost in the flurry of chats, gifs, and unrelated links posted.

Essentials
stackoverflow - When something is stumping you, google it and take a peek at the answers on stackoverflow.  It might give you some insight!
http://builtwith.com/ - All you need to do is enter an url on this site and you'll get to see the building blocks of the site.  (A handy trick is to look a prospective job's website up and familiarize yourself with what they are using.)
http://alternativeto.net/ - If a specific app or program isn't doing the trick, there's usually someone else who has felt the same way and has made something for that.

Practice
	Code
CodeWars - A site for katas and code riddles for practice.  Demands a small code test to join.
Exercism - Another site for coding practice, using GitHub to authenicite.  It provides tests, and you must build your program to pass those code tests.
https://github.com/karan/Projects - A very big list of different code projects, mostly numbers.
https://github.com/csblogs/feed-downloader - A feed that allows you to develop things.  But more importantly, it encourages best practices for github itself.
http://sqlzoo.net/ - SQL Exercises, fairly simple.
http://www.teamtreehouse.com/ - Another site like CodeAcademy, with dozens of tracks to practice on.  Be warned, it only allows for seven days free access, then you have to pay monthly.
http://www.pluralsight.com/ - A variety of videos and courses are on this site, but again, some you'll have to pay for.

	Interviewing
https://www.interviewcake.com/ - A paid site that provides interview questions asked by Google, Amazon, and Facebook, providing advice and tricks for programming interviews.
gainlo.co - While the link is being fussy, the site has a blog (blog.gainlo.co) that chats about thoughts involving mock interviews, system design questions, and more.
https://www.careercup.com/ - Another site for interview code question practice, though in the vein of multiple choice problems.

Diagrams
https://coggle.it/diagram/52e97f8c5a143de239005d1b/56212c4e4c505e0045c0d3bda59b77e5977c2c9bd40f3fd0b451bdcf8da4aa52 - A visual version of alternativeto.net, with some hyperlinks.
