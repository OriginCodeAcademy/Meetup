Hello, and welcome to the archive!  This is intended to help keep track of handy links and recommendations provided on Origin's Slack to ensure that useful links such as internet articles, tutorials, and more don't get lost in the flurry of chats, gifs, and unrelated links posted.</br>

<h3>Essentials</h3>
http://imgur.com/gallery/NsBFh - What IS Programming, anyway?  </br>
http://www.origincodeacademy.com/ - The website for Origin Code Academy in San Diego, California, USA.</br>
stackoverflow - When something is stumping you, google it and take a peek at the answers on stackoverflow.  It might give you some insight!</br>
http://builtwith.com/ - All you need to do is enter an url on this site and you'll get to see the building blocks of the site.  (A handy trick is to look a prospective job's website up and familiarize yourself with what they are using.)</br>
http://alternativeto.net/ - If a specific app or program isn't doing the trick, there's usually someone else who has felt the same way and has made something for that.</br>
http://www.trello.com/ - A scrum site popular with different companies. </br>
http://www.seleniumhq.org/ - Selenium allows for you to test your code automatically, and spares programmers the need to spend a lot of time debugging things themselves.</br>
http://www.meetup.com/ - Networking is essential for young programmers, both for mentoring and looking for work. </br>
